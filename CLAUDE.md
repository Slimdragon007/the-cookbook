## 📜 3. PROJECT-SPECIFIC RULES

### Rule 1 — Nullish coalescing for numeric fields

Use `??`, not `||`. `0 || null` returns `null` (wrong). `0 ?? null` returns `0` (correct).
Macros, calories, portion math all rely on this. Linter does not catch it.

### Rule 2 — Slug-based recipe routing

URLs use slugs (`/recipe/best-goulash`), not UUIDs. `getRecipeById()` looks up by slug first, falls back to UUID for back-compat. Don't break the fallback.

### Rule 3 — USDA-first nutrition pipeline

Ingredient macros come from USDA FoodData Central API. Fallback chain: USDA → Claude AI estimate → hardcoded lookup → 0. Never reverse the order.

### Rule 5 — Single Supabase env-var naming scheme

One naming scheme only:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (server-only, lazy-evaluated via `getSupabaseServiceRoleKey()`)

Wired in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` GH secrets. Resolved in `src/lib/supabase/env.ts`. **Do not introduce a second naming scheme.** The prior Marketplace fallback (`NEXT_PUBLIC_Juliescookbook_*`) was removed 2026-04-25 (TASK-004) as part of the Cloudflare migration. Any new fallback or alias requires an ADR per Law 4 — env-var contracts are parallelization-locked under Law 2.

## 🚧 4. KNOWN PITFALLS

### Pitfall 1 — Dual scraper paths drift _(resolved 2026-04-26)_

**Symptom:** Bug fixes applied to one scraper but not the other; CLI scrape and web scrape produce different ingredient data.
**Cause:** `.mjs` file could not import TypeScript shared modules.
**Status:** Resolved 2026-04-26 (TASK-002 / ADR-002 implementation, Option B). Both paths now call `scrapeRecipe()` from `src/lib/scraper/core.ts`. The CLI is now a TypeScript file run via `tsx`. Discovery during the refactor surfaced that the `.mjs` was actually broken at parse time (an `await` in a non-async function); replacing the broken `validateRecipeData` with the shared async `normalizeIngredients` fixed it.
**Institutional memory:** Pitfall 1 stays in this list as a record of why we maintain a single source of truth for shared logic. The core lesson: when "edit both files" is the only thing keeping two paths in sync, drift is a matter of when, not if.

### Pitfall 2 — ESLint strict failures break the deploy build

**Symptom:** `npm run dev` works, deploy fails.
**Cause:** `next build` (invoked by `@cloudflare/next-on-pages`) runs `next lint` in strict mode. `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` and `prefer-const` are blocking.
**Rule:** Run `npm run lint` before every push. Husky catches most of this; trust it.

### Pitfall 3 — Google Fonts unreachable in sandboxed environments

**Symptom:** `next build` fails locally with font fetch errors.
**Cause:** `fonts.googleapis.com` blocked in some sandboxed envs.
**Rule:** If local build fails on fonts, that's environment, not code. The CI build (Cloudflare Pages via GH Action) will succeed.

### Pitfall 4 — Map iterator downlevelIteration

**Symptom:** `for...of` on `Map.entries()` fails TypeScript compilation.
**Rule:** Use `map.forEach()` instead.

### Pitfall 5 — Same-day fix-after-feat clusters

**Symptom:** 10+ commits on a single day with multiple `fix:` entries patching `feat:` entries from hours earlier (Mar 16, Mar 28 in repo history).
**Cause:** No `task_plan.md` discipline, no PR review, work shipped directly to main.
**Rule:** Tasks declared in `@task_plan.md` before execution. Fix-within-24h-of-feat triggers a doc update per Recursive Learning Loop (base handbook §5).

### Pitfall 6 — Infra ping-pong

**Symptom:** Repo had `vercel.json` AND `wrangler.toml` AND a Cloudflare GitHub Action AND CLAUDE.md said Vercel. Apr 21 had 6 commits in 43 minutes migrating to Cloudflare with no ADR.
**Cause:** Infra change executed as exploration, not decision.
**Status:** Resolved 2026-04-25 by ADR-001 (Cloudflare Pages chosen, `vercel.json` removed). Pitfall 6 stays in this list as institutional memory; the rule below remains active for future infra changes.
**Rule:** Base handbook Law 4 applies. Any future deploy-target, vendor-swap, or build-pipeline change requires an ADR before code lands. No "quick experiments" on `main`.

## 📂 5. POINTER TABLE

```
@task_plan.md                  → current task state (architect-owned)
@progress.md                   → completed work log (append-only)
@docs/trust-contract.md        → pre-flight compliance gate (read at session start + before any file write)
@docs/REFERENCE.md             → schema, env vars, file index, current state
@docs/architecture/ui.md       → Liquid Glass design system, component patterns
@docs/architecture/api.md      → API routes, scraper architecture, chat endpoint
@docs/architecture/data.md     → Supabase schema, RLS, fallback chain
@docs/architecture/infra.md    → Cloudflare Pages deploy state, GH Action CI/CD
@docs/adr/ADR-001-deploy-target.md     → accepted (Cloudflare Pages)
@docs/adr/ADR-002-dual-scraper-paths.md → accepted + implemented 2026-04-26 (Option B, src/lib/scraper/*)
```

**Load triggers:**

- UI work → `@docs/architecture/ui.md`
- API or schema work → `@docs/architecture/api.md` + `@docs/architecture/data.md`
- Scraper work → `@docs/architecture/api.md` + `src/lib/scraper/core.ts` (single source of truth)
- Infra or deploy → `@docs/architecture/infra.md` + ADR-001
- Auth or middleware → `@docs/architecture/data.md` (RLS) + base handbook Law 2

## 🧪 6. DEFINITION OF DONE

- [ ] 0 lint errors (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] 0 TypeScript errors (`tsc --noEmit`)
- [ ] Unit tests pass (`npm run test`, 93 tests)
- [ ] E2E tests pass (`npm run test:e2e`, 28 tests, requires dev server)
- [ ] Husky pre-commit passes
- [ ] `@progress.md` appended with task summary
- [ ] Affected `@docs/*.md` updated if reality changed
- [ ] If scraper logic changed: shared module in `src/lib/scraper/` updated, both callers (`scripts/scrape-recipe.ts` + `src/app/api/scrape/route.ts`) exercised mentally
- [ ] If infra touched: ADR written and committed before code

## 📓 8. NOTION POINTERS (humans only)

Agents do not read Notion as source of truth.

## 🚦 9. CURRENT STATE

_(Last edit: 2026-04-26, post-scraper-refactor)_

**Working in production:** Multi-user with per-user recipes, ingredients, food logs. Invite-only signup. Liquid Glass UI. Portion calculator with USDA macros. Weekly summary page. Chatbot with per-user context. 90 unit tests (83 pass / 7 pre-existing skips) + 28 E2E. Single-source-of-truth scraper module at `src/lib/scraper/`; CLI and web API both wrap `scrapeRecipe()`.

**Mid-build / unresolved:** `@docs/architecture/{ui,api,data}.md` are still stubs; populate as work touches each surface. CLI live smoke test (npm run scrape <real-url>) is a manual post-merge verification — automated coverage now lives in `src/lib/__tests__/scraper-*.test.ts`.

**Recently closed (2026-04-25 → 2026-04-26):** ADR-001 / TASK-001 (Cloudflare Pages canonical, `vercel.json` removed). TASK-004 (Marketplace env-var fallback decommissioned, single Supabase naming scheme). TASK-005 (residual Vercel strings in audit route cleaned up). TASK-006 (legacy `VERCEL` env var removed from Cloudflare Pages). TASK-003 / ADR-003 (`/api/audit` cron restored via GitHub Actions daily schedule). Husky pre-commit gate (`next lint --quiet && tsc --noEmit`) wired up. **TASK-002 / ADR-002 (dual scraper paths refactor, Option B): scraper logic extracted to `src/lib/scraper/`, CLI migrated to TypeScript via `tsx`, web route shrunk from 1,113 → ~95 lines, +37 unit tests added, Rule 4 deleted, Pitfall 1 marked resolved.**

**Blocked:** Any new infra change requires its own ADR per Law 4. UI and API work can proceed in worktrees freely.
